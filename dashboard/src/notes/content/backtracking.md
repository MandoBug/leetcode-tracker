## The idea

Backtracking is walking a **decision tree**. At every step you make a choice, go deeper, and when you come back you undo that choice so you can try the next one. Every complete path from the root to a stopping point is one candidate answer.

It is brute force with good manners. You still try everything, but you build each answer one piece at a time and throw away a branch the moment it can't work.

```diagram
PermutationTree
```

## The three things to find in every problem

Before writing any code, name these three things. If you can say them out loud, the code writes itself.

| Piece | Question to ask | Permutations of [1,2,3] |
|---|---|---|
| **Path** | What have I chosen so far? | the numbers picked, like `[1, 2]` |
| **Choices** | What can I pick next? | any number not used yet |
| **End condition** | When is the path a full answer? | `len(path) == len(nums)` |

## The template

```python title="backtracking template"
def solve(nums):
    res = []   # every complete answer
    path = []  # the choices made so far (one root to node path in the tree)

    def backtrack():
        # 1. end condition: the path is a complete answer
        if is_complete(path):
            res.append(path[:])   # save a COPY, path keeps changing after this
            return

        # 2. try every choice available from this node
        for choice in choices():
            path.append(choice)   # choose: walk down one edge
            backtrack()           # explore everything below that edge
            path.pop()            # undo: walk back up the same edge

    backtrack()
    return res
```

Three lines do all the work: **choose, explore, undo**. The undo is what makes it "back" tracking. When `backtrack()` returns, `path` is exactly what it was before the loop picked `choice`, so the next loop iteration starts clean.

## Why choose and undo sit inside the loop

An **edge** is the line connecting a parent node to a child node. It is not the node itself. Nodes are the states you are in between choices, and edges are the choices.

```diagram
ChooseUndo
```

Backtracking cares about edges. Choosing is walking down an edge and undoing is walking back up it. That is why the append and pop wrap the recursive call inside the `for` loop: each loop iteration is one edge out of the current node.

Compare this with a plain tree traversal, where the work happens at the node (preorder or postorder position). Backtracking does its work on the way into and out of each edge.

## Worked example: Permutations (46)

Order matters, and each number is used once. Since order matters, every level loops over **all** numbers from index 0, and a `used` array skips the ones already on the path.

```python title="46. Permutations"
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        res, path = [], []
        used = [False] * len(nums)   # used[i] is True while nums[i] is on the path

        def backtrack():
            if len(path) == len(nums):      # used every number: one full permutation
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if used[i]:                 # already on the path, can't pick it twice
                    continue
                path.append(nums[i]); used[i] = True     # choose
                backtrack()                              # explore
                path.pop(); used[i] = False              # undo (both things!)

        backtrack()
        return res
```

Step through the first branch to watch `path` and `used` change together:

```diagram
PermutationSteps
```

> **Tip:** Keep `res`, `path`, and `used` in the outer function and give `backtrack` no parameters. Mixing `self.path` with a `path` parameter works by accident (they are the same list) but it is easy to get confused about which one you are changing.

## Subsets (78): every node is an answer

For subsets, order doesn't matter, so `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` are the same answer. The fix is a `start` index: each node only offers numbers **to the right** of the last pick. That way every subset is built in one order only.

```diagram
SubsetTree
```

```python title="78. Subsets"
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        res, path = [], []

        def backtrack(start):
            res.append(path[:])              # record at EVERY node, no end condition needed
            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                path.append(nums[i])
                backtrack(i + 1)             # only look forward, never reuse i
                path.pop()

        backtrack(0)
        return res
```

## Combinations (77): subsets with a size limit

Combinations of size `k` are just the subsets at depth `k`. Same tree, same `start` index, but only record when the path has `k` items, and stop there.

```diagram
CombinationTree
```

```python title="77. Combinations"
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> list[list[int]]:
        res, path = [], []

        def backtrack(start):
            if len(path) == k:               # depth k: save and stop going deeper
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            for i in range(start, n + 1):    # numbers are 1..n here, not indexes
                path.append(i)
                backtrack(i + 1)
                path.pop()

        backtrack(1)
        return res
```

## Reuse allowed: Combination Sum (39)

When the same number can be picked again, recurse with `i` instead of `i + 1`. The child is allowed to pick the same number, but still never one to its left, so you don't get the same combination in two orders.

```python title="39. Combination Sum"
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: list[int], target: int) -> list[list[int]]:
        res, path = [], []

        def backtrack(start, remaining):
            if remaining == 0:               # hit the target exactly
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            if remaining < 0:                # overshot, this branch can't work
                return
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                path.append(candidates[i])
                backtrack(i, remaining - candidates[i])   # i, not i + 1: reuse is allowed
                path.pop()

        backtrack(0, target)
        return res
```

## Duplicates in the input (90, 40, 47)

If the input has repeated values, like `[1, 2, 2]`, two sibling branches that pick the same value grow the exact same subtree. Sort first so equal values sit next to each other, then skip a value if it equals the sibling right before it.

```diagram
DuplicateSkip
```

```python title="the duplicate skip, for subsets and combinations"
nums.sort()                     # equal values must be neighbours for the check to work

def backtrack(start):
    res.append(path[:])
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        # i > start means "not the first option at this level".
        # the first 2 at a level is fine, a second 2 at the SAME level is a repeat
        if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        path.append(nums[i])
        backtrack(i + 1)
        path.pop()
```

It has to be `i > start`, not `i > 0`. With `i > 0` you would also block going deeper with the second 2, which would lose `[2, 2]`.

Permutations with duplicates (47) use `used` instead of `start`, so the rule changes shape:

```python title="47. Permutations II: the skip rule"
nums.sort()
# skip nums[i] if the same value right before it is NOT currently on the path.
# that forces equal values to always be placed in their original order,
# so two identical 2s can never swap places and make a duplicate permutation
if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]:
    continue
```

## The knobs

Every problem in this family is one skeleton with a few settings changed.

| The problem has... | Change |
|---|---|
| order matters | permutation: loop from `0`, use a `used` array |
| order doesn't matter | subset or combination: loop from `start`, recurse with `i + 1` |
| element reuse allowed (39) | recurse with `i` instead of `i + 1` |
| duplicates in input (90, 40) | sort first, then `if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue` |
| duplicates in permutations (47) | sort first, then `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1] and not used[i-1]: continue` |

## All in one template

Two tree shapes (subset or permutation) times three element rules (unique, duplicates, reuse). Fill in the four capital words and you have any of the eight classic problems.

```python title="all in one"
def backtrack(start):
    if END:                            # subset: always record (and don't return)
        res.append(path[:])            # combination: len(path) == k
        return                         # permutation: len(path) == len(nums)

    for i in range(START, len(nums)):  # subset / combination: start
                                       # permutation: 0
        if SKIP:                       # permutation: used[i]
            continue                   # duplicates: nums[i] == nums[i-1] check

        path.append(nums[i])           # choose
        backtrack(NEXT)                # no reuse: i + 1
                                       # reuse: i
        path.pop()                     # undo
```

## Beyond subsets

The same choose, explore, undo loop solves problems that look very different at first:

- **Generate Parentheses (22):** path is the string so far, choices are `(` if you still have opens left and `)` if it wouldn't close more than you opened.
- **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number (17):** each level is one digit, choices are that digit's letters.
- **Word Search (79):** path is the cells used so far, choices are the 4 neighbours. Mark a cell as visited before going deeper and unmark it after.
- **N-Queens (51):** each level is one row, choices are the columns that aren't attacked.
- **Palindrome Partitioning (131):** choices are every palindrome that starts at the current index.

## Complexity

Time is roughly **(number of answers) × (cost to copy one answer)**. You can't beat the number of answers, because you have to produce every one.

| Problem | Time | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Subsets | O(n · 2ⁿ) | 2ⁿ subsets, each copied in O(n) |
| Combinations | O(k · C(n, k)) | C(n, k) answers of length k |
| Permutations | O(n · n!) | n! orderings of length n |

Space is O(n) for the recursion depth and the path, not counting the output.

## Common mistakes

1. **`res.append(path)` instead of `res.append(path[:])`.** Every saved answer points at the same list, which is empty by the end.
2. **Forgetting half of the undo.** In permutations, both `path.pop()` and `used[i] = False` have to happen.
3. **Skipping duplicates without sorting.** The `nums[i] == nums[i-1]` check only works if equal values are next to each other.
4. **`i > 0` instead of `i > start`** in the subset duplicate check, which throws away valid answers like `[2, 2]`.

## Practice

Suggested order: the three base shapes first, then reuse, then duplicates.

```problems
46 | Permutations | permutations | Medium | the base template, with used
78 | Subsets | subsets | Medium | every node is an answer
77 | Combinations | combinations | Medium | subsets that stop at depth k
39 | Combination Sum | combination-sum | Medium | reuse: recurse with i
90 | Subsets II | subsets-ii | Medium | sort + skip duplicates
40 | Combination Sum II | combination-sum-ii | Medium | duplicates and no reuse
47 | Permutations II | permutations-ii | Medium | the not used[i-1] rule
22 | Generate Parentheses | generate-parentheses | Medium | choices depend on counts
17 | Letter Combinations of a Phone Number | letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number | Medium | one level per digit
79 | Word Search | word-search | Medium | backtracking on a grid
131 | Palindrome Partitioning | palindrome-partitioning | Medium | choices are substrings
51 | N-Queens | n-queens | Hard | the classic
```
